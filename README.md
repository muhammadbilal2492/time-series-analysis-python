End-to-end time series analysis and forecasting project using Python, including preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, ARIMA modeling, and critical evaluation.

# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting with Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end time series analysis workflow using Python. The objective was to preprocess time-based data, explore temporal patterns, engineer predictive features, build forecasting models, and critically evaluate advanced modeling approaches.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Tasks Performed
- Data preprocessing and time indexing
- Exploratory time series analysis and visualization
- Stationarity testing and transformation
- Feature engineering (lag features, rolling statistics, EMA)
- Forecasting using ARIMA
- Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
- Critical assessment of deep learning suitability for time series

## Key Learnings
- Importance of stationarity in time series modeling
- Strengths and limitations of classical vs. deep learning models
- Interpretation-focused analysis for real-world forecasting problems
